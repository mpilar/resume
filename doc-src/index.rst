Miguel Pilar's Resume
=====================

I am Miguel Pilar, a Web Developing code monkey turned "DevOps/Inframagical 
Architect". This is my resume written in ReStructuredText and formatted using
sphinx, and not even using a custom sphinx theme.

The format of this resume is inspired by `rdegges 
<http://resume.readthedocs.org>`_ and `wraithan's 
<http://wraithan.readthedocs.org>`_ but using sphinx for a resume seems 
serendipitous.

.. note::
    This is a preliminary experiment of writing a resume with sphinx, as such
    it is in flux and under development until this note disappears. *It will
    probably never disappear.*
