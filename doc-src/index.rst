Miguel Pilar's Resume
=====================

I am Miguel Pilar, a blah blah blah blah

The format of this resume is inspired by `rdegges 
<http://resume.readthedocs.org>`_ and `wraithan's 
<http://wraithan.readthedocs.org>`_ but the serendipity of using sphinx for
a resume seems to be more universal.


.. note::
    This is a preliminary experiment of writing a resume with sphinx, as such
    it is in flux and under development.
