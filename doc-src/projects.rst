Projects
========

Admittedly I do not have a huge portfolio of projects to offer, and only one 
public project per-se, and I think that's one of my largest shortcomings: I 
seldom do my own projects, instead I do small hacks and fixes to other projects 
and submit pull requests.

Public

----------------
gigya-server-lib
----------------

I have only one public project, a port of `Gigya <http://www.gigya.com>`_'s 
SDK to python called 
`gigya-server-lib <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gigya-server-lib/0.1.3>`_. 
The library is not entirely pythonic to maintain it closer in usage to the 
original.

As an aside, while working on this library I discovered a security bug that 
was disclosed to Gigya.

Assorted pull requests
----------------------

I've made small contributions to the following projects:

* Mongo C# Driver:
    - `CSHARP-204 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-204>`_: found, 
      diagnosed and fixed a concurrency issue in the mongodb driver for C#
    - `CSHARP-200 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-200>`_: created a 
      patch in response to a feature request for the C# Driver
* AL-Redis: `a quick patch <https://github.com/angieslist/AL-Redis/pull/5>`_ 
  in response to having seen a TODO on the code. (I never got the chance to use
  AL-Redis but found the TODO while browsing the code.)
* `mumble <http://mumble.sourceforge.net/>`_: No link but some client 
  functionality for saving last connected channel and some other settings 
  c.2005, patch submission was via email/IRC back then.
