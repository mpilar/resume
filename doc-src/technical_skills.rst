Technical Skills
================


This is a list of my stronger technical skills. Through my years
I've made many different small projects with varied purposes. Among
them:

* 6+ years experience with Python and C#
* Have played with many others like Go, Ruby and even AutoIT

##
C#
##

When not programming in Python for work I've had to *maintain* C# applications
be them web, console or desktop. I've had some experience working with ASP.NET 
MVC.

######
Python
######

I've spent the last few years programming in Python professionaly and 
otherwise. Most of my experience with Python is centered around
writing web applications and management scripts.

******
Django
******

For most web projects that interact with databases I enjoy using django. I feel
The django app ecosystem is powerful and make it very easy to create a complex
project quickly and efficiently.

*****
Flask
*****

For smaller web projects and prototypes I turn to Flask, nimble enough to 
create small projects quickly but powerful enough to expand them into larger 
projects. Specially true of projects that don't need an ORM to be tightly 
integrated.

******
Celery
******

When doing tasks asynchronously celery provides a quick and very well designed
platform to do them with.

#####
Redis
#####

I've used Redis as a very powerful hash and key/value store. I am always
impressed with it's speed and stability.

##########
PostgreSQL
##########

This is my preferred relational database.

######
jQuery
######

I don't always have to work with javascript, but when I do, I enjoy using
jQuery for it.

###
Git
###

My preferred source control mechanism, but not the only one I have experience
with.

###
AWS
###

I am familiar with most AWS services, that is to say I've used most of them, 
while I am not an expert at all of them I understand where they are best used
for certain jobs.

######
Asgard
######

I find Netflix' Asgard to be a very powerful tool to manage deployments in AWS.
My experience with it is limited but it's power is obvious for large 
deployments.
