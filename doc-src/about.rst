About Me
========

I am a developer/hacker that has very many interests, both in life and 
technology. I love playing around with technology I've had experience with 
system administration, networking and know enough to shoot myself in the foot 
in very creative ways.

As far as languages :strike:`go` are concerned, I have tried many, have worked
professionally with a range of languages, including C#, Python, go and some ruby 
and have had to debug in few other languages. My favorite language is by far 
python.

Currently I live in Puerto Rico and am a US and Spain dual citizen, allowing me
to work in either country without any elegibility concerns.

For better or worse I am also a typical PC gamer, playing all sorts of game, 
sucking at a lot of them too but most importantly enjoying myself.

Personality
###########

By nature I try to learn many things even if it is to know just the basics, 
to that end I've explored things ranging from blacksmithing to basic home 
repair to welding. I feel that the more breadth of knowledge one has the
easier it is to see problems and solutions in different angles.

I have had a few hobbies through the years, the more recent ones are:

* 3D priting
* Sous Vide Cooking
* Basic Electronics (translation: releasing magic blue smoke every now and then)

Irrational Thoughts
###################

If I have a constant recurring irrational thought is that I am uncomfortable 
with PHP, unlike other languages I have seen I have been unable to find beauty
in a PHP program. Perhaps I have not been introduced to good PHP, but even 
the language design itself seems inelegant to me. This is not to mean I don't
dive into PHP programs to diagnose them or see how they tick, but that it is
well outside my comfort zone.
