About Me
========

I am a developer/hacker that has very many interests, both in life and 
technology. I love playing around with technology I've had experience with 
system administration, networking and know enough to shoot myself in the foot 
in very creative ways.

As far as languages go, I have tried many, have worked professionally with a 
range of languages, including C#, Python and some ruby and have had to debug 
in few other languages. My favorite language is by far python.

For better or worse I am also a typical PC gamer, playing all sorts of game, 
sucking at a lot of them too but most importantly enjoying myself.

Personality
###########

By nature I try to learn many things even if it is to know just the basics, 
to that end I've explored things ranging from blacksmithing to basic home 
repair to welding. I feel that the more breadth of knowledge one has the
easier it is to see problems and solutions in different angles.

I have had a few hobbies through the years, the more recent ones are:

* Homebrewing
* Cheese making
* Charcuterie

Irrational Thoughts
###################

If I have a constant recurring irrational thought is that I despise PHP, 
unlike the plethora of other languages I have seen I can never find beauty 
in a PHP program. Perhaps I have not been introduced to good PHP, but even 
the language design itself seems inelegant to a fault. This is not to mean 
I don't dive into PHP programs to diagnose them or see how they tick, but 
that it is not my comfort zone.
